# ANN-CNN-RNN-Architecture
A beginner-focused notebook showcasing the construction of basic neural network architectures — ANN, CNN, and RNN — using Keras. Includes layer-by-layer breakdowns, model summaries, and printed weights and biases for educational clarity and architecture visualization.

# Neural Networks Architecture: ANN, CNN, and RNN using Keras

This project provides clear and concise implementations of three foundational neural network architectures using Keras and TensorFlow:

- **ANN** (Artificial Neural Network)
- **CNN** (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **RNN** (Simple Recurrent Neural Network)

Each model is structured to help learners understand layer configurations, output dimensions, and internal parameter structures — including how to inspect and interpret weights and biases.

##  What's Inside

 `RNN_ANN_CNN_architecture.ipynb` includes:

- Construction of a basic ANN with two Dense layers
- A CNN using Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers
- A SimpleRNN layer followed by a Dense output layer
- Use of `.summary()` to inspect model architecture
- Use of `model.get_weights()` to extract weights and biases
- Architecture diagrams to visualize flow and tensor dimensions
